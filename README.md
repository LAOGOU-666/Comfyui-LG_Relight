# Comfyui-LG_Relight-ENGLISH for testing (JUN 1 - 2025)
This is a fork for testing the very good project of LAOGOU.
It is a personal/manual translation to English, just for testing.

For the latest code:
https://github.com/LAOGOU-666/Comfyui-LG_Relight

Simple implementation of 3D real-time lighting in Comfyui
Open source node, I wish you all a happy time!

## Added ULTRA version, supports adding multiple light sources and adjusting them independently, supports point light sources, spotlight mode selection, and realizes more comprehensive 3D lighting

## Update modal pop-up window to completely solve the pop-up window problem
- Abandon the original PYQT and JS versions. The current version supports all systems, solves the pop-up window problem, and the operation method is the same as the original

The lighting effect of a single node is limited, and the effect is better with ic_light
